**carlin** has been built for the last years as helpers scripts that support deploying AWS cloud resources. The first scripts were used to deploy CloudFormation templates as we've started performing numerous deployments along with staging, production, development... environments.

As the scripts grew, it was very useful put them all in a CLI and create an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/carlin), this way it can be used by all team in all projects.
