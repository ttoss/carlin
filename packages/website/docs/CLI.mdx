## environment

<OptionHeader option="environment" options={carlin.options.cli} />

We can set the environment of your deployment. Every deploy operation allow we set the <OptionAliasesInline option="environment" options={carlin.options.cli} /> option that defines our environment.
Deployments with an environment commonly tends to be a deploy with permanent resources, like staging and production. Due to this, when environment is defined, some properties changes. For instance:

- [Termination protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html) is automatically enabled.

On the other hand, not defining an environment generally means that the resources are ephemeral. These kind of deploy is used to create parts of applications to be tested by the QA team.

## environments

<OptionHeader option="environments" options={carlin.options.cli} />

**carlin** was projected to work with environments. As we've been building a lot of Apps, we realized that we commonly have some environments, like production and staging. The difference between these environments was some options values that we passed to the deploy command. To handle these options, we've created the <OptionAliasesInline option="environments" options={carlin.options.cli} /> option. It receives an object whose keys are the environment name and the values are an object containing the command options.

Besides <OptionAliasesInline option="environments" options={carlin.options.cli} />, if we provide the option <OptionAliasesInline option="environment" options={carlin.options.cli} to="/docs/CLI#environment" />, **carlin** searches if such environment exists inside environments object and assign the values to the command. For instance, suppose that we have the `carlin.yml` below.

```yaml title="carlin.yml"
region: us-east-1
environments:
  Production:
    region: ap-south-1
```

The `region` value will be, for each command:

| Command                                          | `region`       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `carlin deploy`                                  | **us-east-1**  |
| `carlin deploy --region eu-west-1`               | **eu-west-1**  |
| `carlin deploy -e production`\*                  | **us-east-1**  |
| `carlin deploy -e Production`                    | **ap-south-1** |
| `carlin deploy -e Production --region eu-west-1` | **eu-west-1**  |

:::note

\* `environment` is case sensitive.
