## History

This framework has been built for the last years, since 2018, as helpers scripts that support deploying AWS cloud resources.
We created the first scripts to deploy CloudFormation templates as we've started performing numerous deployments along with staging, production, development environments.

As the scripts grew, it was advantageous to put them all in a CLI using [Yargs](https://yargs.js.org/) and create an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/carlin), to allow the whole team uses it in all projects.

We've changed <Carlin /> API at least five times, trying to provide the better API possible. Currently, <Carlin /> has the best API that we could design, and for that reason, we've decided to open-source it, joining as a [ttoss](https://github.com/ttoss) project. We hope this framework helps a lot of developers deploying AWS cloud resources. We're heavily using it in your projects at [Triângulos Tecnologia](https://triangulostecnologia.com).

We also would love feedback from the community. We'll appreciate it a lot if you want to try and send feedback to us on how we might improve the framework.

## Should I use <Carlin /> in production ⚠️?

**It depends**. We've been using it for a long time, and it suits us very well. We recommend using it if you have these two conditions:

1. **You know all <Carlin /> algorithms.**

2. **You know how to fix a deployment manually if some error occurs.**

Also, it's essential to say that this framework doesn't have many tests yet. We're creating the tests little by little, and some core scripts still don't have unit tests.
Currently, our [tests coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) threshold is:

<CodeBlock className="json">{testsCoverageThreshold}</CodeBlock>
