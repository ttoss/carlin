## Overview

```
carlin deploy static-app
```

This command deploys static apps to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). In a big overview, <Carlin /> performs the algorithm below when this command is executed:

:::note Algorithm

<Algorithm algorithm={carlin.comments.deployStaticApp} />

:::

## Versioning

For every deploy, <Carlin /> uses the current version of the package as key on S3 bucket. For instance, if the version of the package is `2.3.11`, the App files will be uploaded inside `2.3.11/` folder on bucket.
This feature comes in hand when you need to rollback a version. In this case, if [cloudfront](#cloudfront) is enabled, you just need to change the [Origin Path](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath)
to the required version.

## Deployments

The differences among all deployments occurs at the template level. Each option adds a piece of instructions on the final CloudFormation template, that we'll present to you.

### Only S3

This is the most basic deployment. <Carlin /> only deploys the application in a S3 bucket.

:::tip Use Cases

This kind of deployment is good to use to deploy an application to the QA team validade the implementation.

:::

#### CloudFormation Template

<Template json={carlin.templates.staticAppOnlyS3} />

### CloudFront

:::info

<InnerHTML html={carlin.comments.publishLambdaVersionZipFile} />

:::

<Template json={carlin.templates.staticAppCloudFront} />

The main differences between [Only S3](#only-s3) and [CloudFront](#cloudfront) templates.

- CloudFront restricts S3 bucket access. Only CloudFront has access to S3 in this case.

<Template
  json={
    carlin.templates.staticAppCloudFront.Resources.StaticBucketS3BucketPolicy
      .Properties.PolicyDocument
  }
/>
