## Overview

This project was created to help anwsering the question:

> How can we execute commands in our repository in a serverless way?

In other words, how can we setup a structure to execute commands and only pays for the time consumed?

Aiming to create such structure, we've create this CICD module. Before we running

```
carlin deploy cicd
```

let's understand the whole process.

## Serverless Repository

This project was create using [GitHub](https://github.com).

### Creating a SSH Key

1. Create a folder in which you'll save the configurations of the CICD, for instance `cicd`.
1. Create a SSH key following [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key).
   1. You may want to save the keys inside the folder you've created. For example: `Enter file in which to save the key (/home/your-name/.ssh/id_ed25519): ./ssh-key`
   1. Create a `.gitignore` file containing the name of the keys (`ssh-key*` in this example).
1. Create a [deploy key](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys).

### Creating The CICD Stack

1. Create a config file, for example, `carlin.yml` inside your CICD folder with the configuration:

   <Template json={carlinCicdConfig} />

1. Execute

   ```
   carlin deploy cicd
   ```
