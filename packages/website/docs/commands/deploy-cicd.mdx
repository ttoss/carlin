## Overview

This project was created with the goal to anwser this question:

> How can we execute commands in our repository in a serverless way?

In other words, how can we setup a structure to execute commands and only pays for the time and resources consumed? Aiming to create such structure, we've create this CI/CD module.

## Creating The CI/CD Stack

This section will explain how you create the CI/CD stack. The following sections will explain how to configure the stack before running
the command `carlin deploy cicd`.

### GitHub Deploy Key

GitHub was chosen by us because it fits very well in our processes and it offers a great developer experience (DX).
However, we've architected this stack to work with any Git provider, as [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), but we haven't tried
others but GitHub, so this configuration is for GitHub.

1. Create a folder in which you'll save the configurations of the CI/CD in your repository, for example `cicd`.
1. Create a SSH key following [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key).
   1. You may want to save the keys inside the folder you've created. For example: `Enter file in which to save the key (/home/your-name/.ssh/id_ed25519): ./ssh-key`
   1. Create a `.gitignore` file containing the name of the keys (`ssh-key*` in this example).
1. Create a [deploy key](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys) on your GitHub repository.
1. Create a config file, for example, `carlin.yml` inside your `cicd` folder with the configuration:

   ```ts title="carlin.ts"
   export default {
     sshKey: './ssh-key', // Or the name you've chosen.
     sshUrl: 'git@github.com:USER/REPOSITORY.git',
   };
   ```

### Pipelines

Currently, the CI/CD stack supports three pipelines: `pr`, `main` and `tag`. Each pipeline is triggered in a stage of the development
flow explained above.

- `pr`: This pipeline is triggered when a pull request is opened.
- `main`: This pipeline is triggered when a new commit is pushed to the branch `main`.
- `tag`: This pipeline is triggered when a new tag is created.

The commands that will be executed should be defined in the files `commands/[pipeline]` and the pipeline must be added to the `pipelines`
configuration file. For example, if you want to execute the commands `npm run build`, `npm run test` and `carlin deploy`
in the `pr` pipeline, you should create the file `commands/pr` file with the following content:

```sh title="commands/pr"
#!/bin/bash

npm run build
npm run test
carlin deploy
```

and add `pr` to `pipelines` property on the `carlin` configuration file:

```ts title="carlin.ts"
export default {
  pipelines: ['pr'],
};
```

The same is true if you want to add other pipelines:

```ts title="carlin.ts"
export default {
  pipelines: ['pr', 'main', 'tag'],
};
```

Note that you can also define specific pipelines for [differents environments](/docs/CLI#environments):

```ts title="carlin.ts"
export default {
  pipelines: ['pr'],
  environments: {
    Staging: {
      pipelines: ['main'],
    },
    Production: {
      pipelines: ['tag'],
    },
  },
};
```

:::note

Don't forget to create the commands files for each declared pipeline.

### Creating The CI/CD Stack

1. Execute

   ```
   carlin deploy cicd
   ```

1. The CI/CD stack will be created, whose template is:

   <Template json={cicdTemplate} />

The next section will explain all resources created by the CI/CD stack.

## Stack Resources

When deployed, the CI/CD create these resources:

1. [Repository Image Registry](#repository-image-registry)
1. [Repository Image Builder](#repository-image-builder)
1. [CI/CD REST API](#cicd-rest-api)

### Repository Image Registry

<Template json={cicdTemplateEcrRepository} />

#### Running Local

You can test the created image in your local environment following theses steps:

1. Perform a Docker login running the command if you're using [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html):

   ```sh
   aws ecr get-login-password --region ${AWS_REGION} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com
   ```

1. Pull the image:

   ```sh
   docker pull ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${REPOSITORY_NAME}:latest
   ```

1. [Run bash in a disposable new container:](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43309168/8786986)

   ```sh
   docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash $IMAGE_NAME_OR_ID
   ```

1. Run `exit` to close the bash.

### Repository Image Builder

<InnerHTML html={cicdTemplateGetRepositoryImageBuilderComment} />

The [build specification (buildspec)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html) of the repository image builder is show below:

<CodeBlock className="yml">
  {carlinCicdRepositoryImageBuilderBuildSpec}
</CodeBlock>

The [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) used to build the Docker image of the repository is:

<CodeBlock className="dockerfile">
  {carlinCicdRepositoryImageBuilderDockerfile}
</CodeBlock>

### ECS Fargate Task

Once we have the image on registry, the deploymend also creates an [ECS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate) task definition. This task receives commands and execute them in a Docker container using the repository image.
The code below shows that base task configuration.

<Template json={carlinCicdRepositoryEcsTaskDefinition} />
