## Overview

This project was created with the goal to anwser this question:

> How can we execute commands in our repository in a serverless way?

In other words, how can we setup a structure to execute commands and only pays for the time and resources consumed? Aiming to create such structure, we've create this CI/CD module.

## Creating The CI/CD Stack

This section will explain how you create the CI/CD stack. We're going to create the stack with a basic configuration
just to understand better its operation. The next section will explain each stack component with more details.

Before running the command `carlin deploy cicd`, we need to create some configuration with [GitHub](https://github.com).
GitHub was chosen by us because it fits very well in our processes and it offers a great developer experience (DX).
However, we've architected this stack to work with any Git provider, as [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), but we haven't tried yet.

### Creating a SSH Key

1. Create a folder in which you'll save the configurations of the CI/CD in your repository, for example `cicd`.
1. Create a SSH key following [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key).
   1. You may want to save the keys inside the folder you've created. For example: `Enter file in which to save the key (/home/your-name/.ssh/id_ed25519): ./ssh-key`
   1. Create a `.gitignore` file containing the name of the keys (`ssh-key*` in this example).
1. Create a [deploy key](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys) on yout GitHub repository.

### Creating The CI/CD Stack

1. Create a config file, for example, `carlin.yml` inside your `cicd` folder with the configuration:

   ```yaml title="carlin.yml"
   sshKey: ./ssh-key
   sshUrl: git@github.com:USER/REPOSITORY.git
   ```

1. Execute

   ```
   carlin deploy cicd
   ```

1. The CI/CD stack will be created, whose template is:

   <Template json={cicdTemplate} />

## Stack Resources

### Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

<Template json={cicdTemplateEcrRepository} />

#### Running Local

You can test the created image in your local environment following theses steps:

1. Perform a Docker login running the command if you're using [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html):

   ```sh
   aws ecr get-login-password --region ${REGION} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com
   ```

1. Pull the image:

   ```sh
   docker pull ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com/${REPOSITORY_NAME}:latest
   ```

1. [Run bash in a disposable new container:](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43309168/8786986)

   ```sh
   docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash $IMAGE_NAME_OR_ID
   ```

1. Run `exit` to close the bash.
