This project was created to optimize apps delivery and improve developer experience. It helps structure development process to help users focus on delivering value as soon as possible.

The processes are very linked to the ones we created since 2019 at [Triângulos Tecnologia](https://triangulostecnologia.com). This project is part of the [Triângulos Tecnologia Open Source Software (TTOSS)](https://github.com/ttoss) initiative.

We summarize all verbose tasks like monorepo and React components creation; AWS deployment; helper scripts among others.

This way we don't have to worry about configuring a monorepo structure, we just have to run:

```
carlin monorepo
```

inside a directory and all the configurations are up.
